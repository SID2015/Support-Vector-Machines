# Support-Vector-Machines


In the first part  , we will implement SVM on 2D dataset. We will experiment with the datasets and will learn how to use a Gaussian Kernel with SVM.

In the second part , we will be using a SVM to build a Spam Classifier.In this dataset, the positions of the positive examples (indicated with +) and the
negative examples (indicated with o) suggest a natural separation indicated by the gap. However, notice that there is an outlier positive example + on
the far left at about (0.1, 4.1). Here , we will also see how this outlier affects the SVM decision boundary.


In the first part, we will try using different values of the C parameter with SVMs. Informally, the C parameter is a positive value that controls the penalty for misclassified training examples. A large C parameter tells the SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly. C plays a role
similar to 1/λ , where λ is the regularization parameter
